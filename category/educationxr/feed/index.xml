<p>EducationXR is an extended reality (XR) platform that addresses creation, deployment, and distribution of immersive content to all phones, tablets, desktops, and VR headsets.</p>



<p>The platform comprises of three main parts:</p>



<ol>
<li> A Unity package called Caffeine that allows creators to design, publish, and test their EducationXR content from the Unity editor with ease</li>



<li>Viewer applications to consume a creator&#8217;s EducationXR content on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Oculus Quest, PCVR, Pico, and VisionPro)</li>



<li>A website to manage a creator&#8217;s organization, users, roles, and content.</li>
</ol>

</div></figure>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>My responsibilities as the Senior Unity Developer laid primarily in the Caffeine package and the viewer applications. Over my nearly 3 years at EducationXR, I led development on many features:</p>



<ul>
<li>web view integration</li>



<li>single sign-on authentication</li>



<li>code authentication</li>



<li>account deletion</li>



<li>gradual sign-on and registration</li>



<li>PDF attachments</li>



<li>URL attachments</li>



<li>VR Passthrough</li>



<li>Visual scripting node development</li>



<li>material optimizer</li>



<li>performance debugger</li>



<li>and many more</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, I collaborated closely with our development team, participated in company game jams as a form of dogfooding, contributed greatly to UI/UX overhauls, and submitted countless bug fixes.</p>
