The astronauts used Eagle\u2019s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled the ship out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armstrong\u2019s first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience.
