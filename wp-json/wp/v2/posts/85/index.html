Cody. \u201cIt gave our visitors an aerial overview of the show but lacked action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat the IDIA captured for us is the look and feel of the experience, right down to the sound effects of horses and the stage coach running through the arena.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buffalo Bill\u2019s Muncie visit<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>IDIA-created augmented reality apps will feature objects in the museums\u2019 collections, such as firearms.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Virtual Buffalo Bill project offered a crossover research opportunity for Connolly, director of Ball State\u2019s Center for Middletown Studies. The center is developing&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/cms.bsu.edu\/academics\/centersandinstitutes\/middletown\/research\/virtual\/virtual\">Virtual Middletown<\/a>, a 3-D visualization of industrializing early 20th-century Muncie, and the Buffalo Bill simulation offered an opportunity to produce a module as part of that endeavor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connolly and Seefeldt provided Fillwalk with photographs and newspaper accounts of Buffalo Bill\u2019s 1899 stop in Muncie. \u201cHe personified the Wild West for audiences in these small towns,\u201d Connolly said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connolly\u2019s and Seefeldt\u2019s research, along with assets provided by the Buffalo Bill Center, allowed Fillwalk and his artists to create beautifully rendered graphics based on data and research, hallmarks that have distinguished IDIA\u2019s work in emergent media design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe attack on the Deadwood Stage Coach is simulated down to representing John Y. Nelson, one of America\u2019s original Mountain Men driving the coach,\u201d Fillwalk explained. \u201cAnd Cody himself\u2014along with his wardrobe\u2014was painstakingly researched and re-created. His appearance was based on specific clothing of Cody\u2019s in the museum collection that we were allowed to photograph.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seefeldt said Fillwalk\u2019s re-creations uniquely capture William F. \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHis show had it all\u2014buffalos, the Pony Express, Annie Oakley, re-enactments of iconic events in the history of the West. He was one of the most famous people in the country, a celebrity of that era, and it\u2019s a thrill to see the way John has brought him back to life.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ball State-Center of the West partnership continues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in Cody, Wyoming, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/centerofthewest.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buffalo Bill Center of the West<\/a>&nbsp;includes the Buffalo Bill, Draper Natural History, Whitney Western Art, Plains Indian and Cody Firearms museums, along with the McCracken Research Library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Origins of Buffalo Bill<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in 1846, William F. Cody rode for the Pony Express, served as a military scout and earned his moniker \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d while hunting the animals for the Kansas Pacific Railroad work crews. Beginning in 1883, he became one of the world\u2019s best showmen with the launch of Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West, which was staged for 30 years, touring America and Europe multiple times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDIA Lab\u2019s next project for the center will be a series of augmented reality apps featuring objects in each museum\u2019s collection. By holding electronic devices over images like a grizzly bear or gun, users can learn more about them as 3-D models of the subjects pop up on screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy using their phones or tablets, visitors can see museum exhibits come to life,\u201d Fillwalk said. \u201cAll of our work is meant to give visitors a greater appreciation for these assets with the aid of our digital interpretations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnston said what he likes best about Fillwalk\u2019s approach is the way \u201che puts technology in the users\u2019 hands.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many younger people walking through our museums with their heads down, glued to their iPhones and iPads. With John\u2019s help, I\u2019m excited that we\u2019re taking something they\u2019re so familiar with and using it in a way to get them to engage with our exhibits here.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funding for the Virtual Buffalo Bill project was provided by a grant from the Buffalo Bill Center for the West, which was matched by internal grant funding from Ball State.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By&nbsp;<a
