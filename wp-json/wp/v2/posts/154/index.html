This exhibit builds on the success of a prior exhibition curated by Fillwalk, that examined the emergence of the genre of Intermedia Art, with a particular focus on the intersection of technology and artmaking. The new show shifts the curatorial emphasis on STEAM \u2013 science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exhibition continues to position Ball State as an international center of STEAM innovation. A goal of Engaging Technology II was to invite artists exploring the edges of art and science into discourse within our community\u2014advancing our University\u2019s conversation regarding interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. This collection of artists examines various aspects of the physical and life sciences, from code and biology to chemistry and physics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those individuals whose work is featured in the exhibition is Adam Brown, an associate professor at Michigan State University. His live biochemical installation, The Great Work of the Metal Lover is a work that sits at the intersection of art, science and alchemy.&nbsp;\u201cIt uses microbiology as a technique to solve the mystery of the philosopher\u2019s stone,\u201d said Brown, who described the centuries-old \u201cstone\u201d as a legendary substance sought by alchemists who believed it capable of turning metals like mercury into gold and silver.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His installation uses custom lab equipment to introduce a \u201chighly specialized\u201d bacterium into an engineered atmosphere, turning toxic gold chloride into usable 24K gold over time during the course of the show. \u201cBy the end of the exhibition,&nbsp;the process will produce enough gold to put in the palm of your hand,\u201d Brown said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other innovative contributors to \u201cEngaging Technology II\u201d include code artist Casey Raes; composer and visual artist Tristian Perich; and Evelina Domnitch and Dmitry Gelfand, European-Russian artists who create sensory immersion environments that merge physics, chemistry and computer science with uncanny philosophical practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c10000 Peacock Feathers in Foaming Acid\u201d is Evelina Domnitch and Dmitry Gelfand\u2019s live, audiovisual performance which was presented on the fulldome projection screen of Ball State\u2019s Charles W. Brown Planetarium. The artwork uses a penetrating laser beam to scan the surface of soap bubbles, the behavior of which model the unique properties of<br>cell membranes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the run of Engaging Technology II, a series of invited performances, lectures and workshops were scheduled on campus and in the Muncie community to enhance the exhibition\u2019s reach. Classes, workshops, lectures and family events were offered for local<br>and regional audiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By Gail Werner, BSU Media Strategist<br>Et al.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The interplay of art and science\u2014a concept at least as old as Leonardo da Vinci\u2014is the focus of \u201cEngaging Technology II,\u201d an exhibition at Ball State University\u2019s David Owsley Museum of Art which ran September 28, 2017 through December 22, 2017.
